# How to install and run the project
In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm install`
#### `npm start`

## Overview

The game is being implemented using simple DOM elements without fancy graphics or canvas elements to focus on essential functionality. It allows only a single player to play on a pre-defined size board, with one set of symbols or images randomly hidden for matching. The development process follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, with unit tests using mocks and spies to verify frontend updates based on game logic and player interactions. 

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building user interfaces, often used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications
- **CSS:** Custom styling for the overall appearance.
- **MaterialUI:** For the overall design and layout of the application.
